Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: git allows users to manage the repositories and files within a git 
directory. The appeal of git is its ability to stage and commit changes 
leaving us with the ability to freely access the history of files, or take a 
whole new direction with a file through the use of branches. Furthermore, we 
can easily collaborate with other users due to repository.
